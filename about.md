Hi! I'm Charles and I am a game designer and developer. I've been making games professionally for over fifteen years but games generally for over thirty! I'm currently lead of the Community Engineering team making games for [Dot Big Bang](https://www.dotbigbang.com).

You can find my tiny repitoire of personal games on Itch:

I'm also extremely slowly making a game audio library for the web written in TypeScript called [Mixdown](https://github.com/meheleventyone/mixdown).
