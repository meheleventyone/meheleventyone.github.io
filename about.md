Hi! I'm Charles and I am a game designer and developer. I've been making games professionally for fifteen years and am currently a Community Engineer making games for [Dot Big Bang](https://www.dotbigbang.com).



You can find my tiny repitoire of personal games on Itch:

I'm also making a game audio library for the web written in TypeScript called [Mixdown](https://github.com/meheleventyone/mixdown).
